 Help Vividarts setup the right environment
 To set up the right environment, first I tried to run the app.py. It broughut an error that it could not trace 'flask'.
 With research, I was able to establish how to install flask in the python environment
 using this line in the command prompt;
       pip install flask

 After installation, the app ran. 
 We then created a work flow, which the rest of the team reviewed before moving towards the tasks to improve the app's effeciency.
